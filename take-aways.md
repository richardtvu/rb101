# Take-aways

- `map` **always** returns an array. 
- `if` statement will return `nil` if none of the conditions evaluate as true ([source](https://launchschool.com/lessons/85376b6d/assignments/fd13de08), problem #9). 
- `each` and iterators work "on the original array in real time." 
- Removing elements while iterating over a collection changes the value passed in for the next iteration (https://launchschool.com/lessons/85376b6d/assignments/a76c28ac, problem #8).  
- When working string return values and comparing strings, make sure to check casing! e.g. `"kid" == 'Kid'` will return `false` and could cause a test case to fail.
