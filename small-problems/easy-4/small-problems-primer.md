# How to Work with RB101-109 Small Problems Exercise Checklist  

## During Problem Solving 

- If something doesn't work: 
  - [ ] Why might it not work? 
  - [ ] What error messages am I getting? 
  - [ ] Explore what's happening in irb. 
  - [ ] _Think_ about what need to change, instead of hack and slash. 

- [ ]After a period of struggle, take a break and come back later.  
  - e.g. Easy question: 25 min -> Break. 
  - e.g. Medium question => { Medium Break => (25 min -> Break) x 2 -> Longer_Break } 
  - e.g. Hard question => { Long Break Protocol => (25 min -> Break) x 4  -> Longer_Break } 


## Post-Problem Solving Questions 

### LS Analysis 

1. What does LS's solution do differently than mine? 

2. Why do I think LS did it the way he did? 

3. Does my program miss some of the "edge cases"?

### Comparison with Other Students' Solution 

1. Were there any solutions that interested me? Why? 

2. How can I use their solutions to improve my code? 

3. What do I want to follow up on? 

## Post-Analysis Steps 

- [ ] Move on to next question. 
- [ ] Come back and redo original problem from scratch. 
- [ ] If successful:
  - [ ] attempt Further Exploration (FE)
  - [ ] compare solution against other students. 
- [ ] Else:
  - [ ] Repeat from beginning (i.e. move on and come back later)
