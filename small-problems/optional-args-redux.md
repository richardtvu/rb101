# Optional Arguments Redux

https://launchschool.com/exercises/4debd143

At first, I had trouble finding the documentation because I assumed that the documentation would be in the core library. Instead, the Data class is actually in the standard library, e.g. (https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html). I believe that I can tell the difference by remembering that the core library will not require an import, but the standard library will need a `requqire` to be used.  

That being said, the relevant documentation for this problem can be found at https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-c-civil.
