# Number Guessing Game

A friend of yours wrote a number guessing game. The first version he shows you picks a random number between 1 and a provided maximum number and offers you a given number of attempts to guess it.

However, when you try it, you notice that it's not working as expected. Run the code and observe its behavior. Can you figure out what is wrong?
