=begin
- Input: Integer (number of switches, also the number of repetitions) 
- Output: Array (the lights on)
- Requirements:
  - The light switches start in the off position. 
  - On each repetition, the light switches flip state on multiples of the current repetition. 
    e.g. 4th iteration: 4, 8, 12... 
  - Repeat above process until we've reached the nth.
  - Implicit Requirement: 
    - The light is on when there is only a single light. 
  - Questions:
    - What happens when n is a negative number? 

Examples: 
- n = 1 => [1]
- n = 5 => 

[1, , , 4, ]
