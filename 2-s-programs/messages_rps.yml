    ===========================================================
    Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played in a 3x3 square.

    computer until one wins or a tie occurs. 

    Game Conditions:
    - Win: You get three in a row (diagonally, horizontally,
    vertically) before the computer.
    - Tie: The board gets filled before either you or the
    computer wins. 
    - Lose: The computer gets three in a row before you.
